# CovidAid
## Inspiration
Social distancing and lockdown has become the necessary evil in this global pandemic situation, and everyone is struggling getting basic day to day things.But this dilemma becomes a lot more serious for the older people and the COVID patients who are living alone in small cities, where you don't have grocery delivery apps, or medicine delivery apps. In these bad times, people normally tend to depend on community for help,and that's where *CovidAid* steps in :bulb: to ease the situation.
## What it does
CovidAid is a community-driven platform for the people, where helpful people can locate the help-seeking people and fulfill their request with mutual consent, based on the location and proximity. It provides every user with basically two main roles,they can choose from,
1. **Ask for help** - This is for help-seekers, who can put forth their request using the app with all relevant details,which will be posted to the timeline as a live request.
2. **Like to help** - This is for the helpers, who can choose to pick up any request as per their convenience from the list of posted live requests on timeline.

To make things interesting and track people's inherent kindness, we have also provided a leaderboard where users can check their *kindness points*, which is something you earn when you help others.

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into it
Keeping the UI lucid and intuitive as our motto is to help people, especially the older people.
Implementing the login functionality using Flask-Login by making use of sessions. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Coming up with a solution to situational problem which helps our community.
## What I learned
I learnt to implement REST apis for backend services using Flask.
Also learnt to use SQLAlchemy as the ORM tool, which makes it easy to work with database.
## What's next for CovidAid
